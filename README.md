# JavaScript Calculator
Built using React.js

## Description

I built this calculator to help me deepen my understanding of both JavaScript and React.js and to practice my CSS grid skills. The HTML is very minimal as my React code, housed in the .js file, does all the heavy lifting of rendering HTML from JSX. A variety of functions are built into the React code to determine the logic of the calculator and govern which keys can be pressed in which order.

## Getting Started

I commented fairly extensively throughout the files, but please let me know if you have any questions. To view this project live on GitHub pages, please visit [this link](https://jamie-ev.github.io/JavaScript_Calculator/). Thanks for dropping by!
